      <h2>About</h2>
      <h2> </h2>
      <i>Nov 27, 2025</i>
        <p>My name is Mitchell Said. I was born on October 10th, 2003. This means I am 22 years old. I have chosen to make a blog because I have become dissillusioned with the current implementation of social media. I hope that this blog can be a healthier expression of myself.</p>
        <p>I want this website to be a place where I can talk about whatever I want. Separate from the whole social media thing, I have wanted to start a blog for a while. I have a lot of views and opinions that I want to share. I want to practice writing on here, a skill that has been lost after a half decade of engineering study. I am also a pretty political guy, in a far left kind of way. So it is also possible that there will be articles or opinion pieces on here relating to that. I also have a place to write about my interests past and present. A place to document my listening tastes and preferences. And finally a place to share some of my own creative output.</p>
        <P>Anyway some more about me. My role models/inspirations are Nick Mullen, Joshua Citarella, Che Guevara, and honestly Zohran Mamdani. Seriously that guy is one of the most inspring things to happen in my lifetime and I believe that wholeheartedly.</P>
        <p>Below is my friend Nick Mullen.</p>

        <h3>New Year New Stuff I guess</h3>
        <i>Jan 5, 2026</i>
        <p>Alright this one is going to be a lot less focused on one singular topic, the topic for this one is topics. I have not updated this website in almost 3 weeks which is much worse considering I have effectively had no responsibilities for the past 2 weeks. It was Christmas, I finished exams and everything and the only thing I feel like I really did was spend one day recording a 1-minute cover of a song. This is ok though I guess. I would have liked to do a lot more, specifically play the drums more but it is increasingly hard to do that with my entire family in the house. I yearn so badly for my own drumming space (see What is a Home post). Anyway some things that have been on my mind as of late. Seriously considering getting an e-reader. I don't even read books, I think after the iPod and PSP I'm just addicted to buying junk. Although maybe I would read more if I had an e-reader... I already pirate all my media, maybe that's what's holding me back with books. I could always read PDFs on my computer but that's stupid I want a little device with a quaint e-ink screen to lull me to sleep (it is 2:42am as I write this). So yeah e-reader is on my radar. I'm looking at older Sony ones that have no wi-fi connectivity and no touch screen. Ok next up, I have found a new niche business idea that I would like to pursue. Add this to the list of things I want to do with my life. I almost don't even want to say what it is because there's only three companies in Canada that do it and I don't want to create more competition for myself. Ok fine. Historical Windows. Yeah it sounds boring and stupid, you (the reader) probably wouldn't even like it. I have this weird fixation with historical carpentry and I think a lot of it is just that I want to have a cool ornate house with lots of fancy millwork. Back to windows though, from what I can tell there is a serious need for historical wood framed windows and something called a sash. People that live in historical or heritage homes need to buy windows that are historically accurate I believe. Same for businesses. Institutions like universities too. And of course regular people that want nicer looking windows. Next on the list. Treeplanting. I'm starting to sort out what my year could look like. This is much more manageable than trying to figure out what the rest of my life will look like. I applied to a fulltime new-grad engineering government job and it would be great if I got that... but... but I think I want to spend 2 months in the British Colombia wilderness planting trees for 11 hours a day instead. I feel like anyone that goes on to do anything worthwhile has some kind of journey. Maybe this could be the start of that for me. I've been reading a lot about it, really I need to start applying to jobs right now. Anyway I think it would be really cool to do that, then spend the second half of the summer just hanging out in BC. Ok another thing that sorta ties back into the Treeplanting thing possibly. I feel like my free time in the bush camp would be a really good opportunity to read and learn stuff. Something I really need to learn and actually understand is music theory. I have been doing instruments for 6 years and I cannot read sheet music. I do not know the circle of fifths. I do not know what different modes are. I think I need to just get a big book that explains all this stuff and if I use whatever free time I have to read it, I fear I may actually learn something. Alright so onto life after treeplanting. Presumably I will be done school so it's not like I have anything I need to be doing. Sometime in the fall I think I want to do some kind of Europe trip. I kinda just thought of this today so I'm not really sure where I would go or for how long but it would be cool to go to a lot of places. Lastly, I have just consulted my notes app on my phone and it says "Watch Sopranos". I will do this.</p>

        <h3>My Future</h3>
        <i>Dec 16, 2025</i>
        <p>I do not have an addictive personality. I've known this. I've never had any problems with substances or become reliant on anything like that. What I do have, which I have only just put to words, is an obsessive personality. I think I have a tendency to obsess over things in a way that you wouldn't consider normal, but also not an addiction. One example of this is my keen obsession with my own future. I think it makes sense to be interested in your own future. It feels pretty reasonable to me, but then I often see people that make me think it's not such a universal thing. I guess this obsession has been ramping up as I get closer and closer to graduating. Spiraling isn't the right word because I don't feel negative about anything, but something about the rate that I am coming up with new dreams and aspirations does feel at least a little bit manic. I don't see this as a bad thing. I would rather pursue any of these weird lifestyles/pathways than end up working in an office for the next 30 years. I think that's the only outcome I would consider failure. I think it's easy to disregard this kind of thinking as naive and immature but I don't think I'm stupid. I feel like I am about to get off this train that left the station literally the moment I was born. I have had no ability to change course or even get off but now after 22 years I'm reaching the first stop. I could stay on board and get the corporate job and get married and buy a house and all the things that everyone else would like to see me do for their own weird sense of pride, but I want to get off the train. I want to stretch my legs and breathe fresh air. There is no certainty getting off the train but there is agency and there is the ability to live a life by me for me. I cannot do everything I want to do. The best I can hope for is that the things I decide to do provide me with fulfillment, and if they don't, at least allow me to move on to try the next thing. I do not judge anyone for staying on the train, a sentiment which does not feel mutual. I can only assume this reaction is an expression of jealousy or admiration. They just can't make sense of it because it goes against all the principles taught on the train. It does feel very strange to me, the sort of unspoken rigidity of western corporate life. There's no way all of these people want the same thing out of life. And there's even less way that the thing they want is a 60 hour work week in an office doing work that provides no tangible benefit to anyone. I think that this, along with having kids, for a lot of people represents a failure to achieve individual fulfillment. Obviously I am not saying everyone that has a job and has kids has failed in life, but I do think it represents a lot of people. What I'm getting at is that instead of trying to achieve things that come from within, they pursue externally motivated goals. Goals constructed by the western neoliberal society we live in. Metrics by which they can comfortably consider their life a success. Money, property, marriage, kids. Just ignore the wife that resents him and the kids that hate them both. He was never able to figure out what mattered to him, but he can still sleep soundly at night. His life was a success. This was the trains destination.  </p>

      <h3>They Are Gutting A Body of Water</h3>
      <h2>  </h2>
        <i>Dec 08, 2025</i>
        <p>This should come as no surprise if you've read my interests post from a couple days ago. I've been listening to TAGABOW since 2023 when their song Eightball came up in my Spotify discover weekly. I didn't listen to much more of them for a few months when I found out (too late) that they were coming to Toronto. They were opening for Panchiko I believe and tickets for that sold out. I got really into them over the following summer and fall so when I found out they were back in Toronto in November I made sure I bought tickets as soon as I could. They were opening for Julie, who I had never heard of at the time. Also playing was Her New Knife. I was super excited to see them and had to explain to my 50+ year old co-workers that I was seeing a band called "They are gutting a body of water". Anyway by the time I got to the venue, TAGABOW had posted on their instagram account that their bus broke down and they wouldn't be able to make it to the show. That was really dissappointing but the show ended up being really good. I sorta had a Julie phase afer that. Anyway back to TAGABOW. Since finally getting to see them live the other day, I have been listening to their new album obsessively. I've been watching and reading interviews with the band in between studying for my exams. Today I taught myself the riff from "American Food" on guitar by ear. It's not perfect I think. Anyway I'm really into this album. My favourite songs are The Chase, Sour Diesel, Trainers, and American Food. I need to figure out how to make music that sounds like this. This will be my winter break project once exams are done.</p>

      <h2>  </h2>
      <i>Nov 27, 2025</i>
        <p>Music, I feel has been my most "legitimate" creative output for the better part of 6 years. I started doing this with no prior training, no knowledge of software, no ability to play any instruments. Tutorials bored me. All of the progress I made in this medium was through trial and error. Progress was very slow, and my limited ability led me to establish my own workflow and methods. I created the vast majority of my music between 2020-2023. I have never stopped but I have significantly slowed down. I still write songs often, just fewer are recorded and developed. This is not an amazing feeling but my life has changed greatly in very positive ways that unfortunately did not translate to music. Still I feel the quality of what I do record has continued to increase. I am immesnely proud of the 200 some songs that I have recorded. I encourage anyone reading this to listen to the songs below and explore what else exists on my bandcamp profile. In the past all of my music was recorded using FL Studio. I was initially very unhappy with the sound of VST instruments. This led me to become effective enough at playing a number of instruments. To date I can play the Guitar, Bass, Drums, Accordion, and Banjo. I would like to add musical saw to this list. Recently I have begun using Ableton. Despite a lack of output to prove the following statement, I do believe that my songwriting is in the best place it's ever been. Time will tell if this is true.</p>
