      <h2> </h2>
      <i>Nov 27, 2025</i>
        <p>My name is Mitchell Said. I was born on October 10th, 2003. This means I am 22 years old. I have chosen to make a blog because I have become dissillusioned with the current implementation of social media. I hope that this blog can be a healthier expression of myself.</p>
        <p>I want this website to be a place where I can talk about whatever I want. Separate from the whole social media thing, I have wanted to start a blog for a while. I have a lot of views and opinions that I want to share. I want to practice writing on here, a skill that has been lost after a half decade of engineering study. I am also a pretty political guy, in a far left kind of way. So it is also possible that there will be articles or opinion pieces on here relating to that. I also have a place to write about my interests past and present. A place to document my listening tastes and preferences. And finally a place to share some of my own creative output.</p>
        <P>Anyway some more about me. My role models/inspirations are Nick Mullen, Joshua Citarella, Che Guevara, and honestly Zohran Mamdani. Seriously that guy is one of the most inspring things to happen in my lifetime and I believe that wholeheartedly.</P>
        <p>Below is my friend Nick Mullen.</p>

        <h3>My Future</h3>
        <i>Dec 16, 2025</i>
        <p>I do not have an addictive personality. I've known this. I've never had any problems with substances or become reliant on anything like that. What I do have, which I have only just put to words, is an obsessive personality. I think I have a tendency to obsess over things in a way that you wouldn't consider normal, but also not an addiction. One example of this is my keen obsession with my own future. I think it makes sense to be interested in your own future. It feels pretty reasonable to me, but then I often see people that make me think it's not such a universal thing. I guess this obsession has been ramping up as I get closer and closer to graduating. Spiraling isn't the right word because I don't feel negative about anything, but something about the rate that I am coming up with new dreams and aspirations does feel at least a little bit manic. I don't see this as a bad thing. I would rather pursue any of these weird lifestyles/pathways than end up working in an office for the next 30 years. I think that's the only outcome I would consider failure. I think it's easy to disregard this kind of thinking as naive and immature but I don't think I'm stupid. I feel like I am about to get off this train that left the station literally the moment I was born. I have had no ability to change course or even get off but now after 22 years I'm reaching the first stop. I could stay on board and get the corporate job and get married and buy a house and all the things that everyone else would like to see me do for their own weird sense of pride, but I want to get off the train. I want to stretch my legs and breathe fresh air. There is no certainty getting off the train but there is agency and there is the ability to live a life by me for me. I cannot do everything I want to do. The best I can hope for is that the things I decide to do provide me with fulfillment, and if they don't, at least allow me to move on to try the next thing. I do not judge anyone for staying on the train, a sentiment which does not feel mutual. I can only assume this reaction is an expression of jealousy or admiration. They just can't make sense of it because it goes against all the principles taught on the train. It does feel very strange to me, the sort of unspoken rigidity of western corporate life. There's no way all of these people want the same thing out of life. And there's even less way that the thing they want is a 60 hour work week in an office doing work that provides no tangible benefit to anyone. I think that this, along with having kids, for a lot of people represents a failure to achieve individual fulfillment. Obviously I am not saying everyone that has a job and has kids has failed in life, but I do think it represents a lot of people. What I'm getting at is that instead of trying to achieve things that come from within, they pursue externally motivated goals. Goals constructed by the western neoliberal society we live in. Metrics by which they can comfortably consider their life a success. Money, property, marriage, kids. Just ignore the wife that resents him and the kids that hate them both. He was never able to figure out what mattered to him, but he can still sleep soundly at night. His life was a success. This was the trains destination.  </p>
        <h3>TAGABOW Concert</h3>
        <i>Dec 07, 2025</i>
        <p>I'm writing this at 3:58AM. Tonight I travelled a cumulative 7 hours to Toronto and back. Today began at about 3:00pm when I woke up and checked googled maps to see how I'd be getting to the venue. No trains running on lakeshore west today... After eating 6 slices of Little Caesars stuffed crust pepperoni pizza, I was out the door. One of my friends would be joining me on this trek. It took us 4 hours and 3 different transit services to get there. The first thing we did after getting in was look at the merch table. I've been really good about not buying any clothes in the last few months so I decided to splurge. This is definitely the right word considering one t-shirt was $50. There were about 5 different options to pick from and I chose the first one that jumped out to me. However in hindsight there were a couple different options I maybe should've considered instead. I got some raspberry sour at the bar and then they started letting everyone into the actual venue towards the back of the building. TAGABOW (They are Gutting a Body of Water) typically play in the middle of the room, not on the stage. I was excited to see if they would do this at this venue. I've been here before and it's a pretty small room so I wasn't sure if it would happen. We walked into the sparsely filled room and sure enough a makeshift stage was built in the middle of the room, holding a drumset and mic stands. To be honest I wasn't sure if there were going to be any openers but nevertheless, I told my friend that we should stay near the middle stage, as opposed to the one at the back of the room. After a bit of a wait the first band got on the back stage. They were called Snoozer and they weren't really anything that special. They had one song that opened with a harmonics-y riff which sounded cool. Otherwise they were a pretty typical shoegaze alt-rock kinda thing with songs that didn't really captivate me. It felt like a lot of the time their songs were one new chord or bass note change away from being really cool but that just never came. Second opener was called Hooky. Initially I thought they were really cool sounding. Live guitarist/autotuned (non-derogatory) vocalist, with a live dj that was doing a lot of super cool stuff that I don't really know how to explain. Unfortunately every song they played ended up sounding the exact same. The gimmick grew stale. I did actually check them out on Spotify and they genuinely sound really good on there. I think 2 people is just not enough to do their songs justice in a live setting. Ok so then TAGABOW gets on stage. Keep in mind I am literally as close as you can possibly be (I'm lying there was a girl who was like 5'0 in front of me but practically speaking nothing was between me and Doug). The band was genuinely within arms reach. So then they started playing aaaaaand nevermind someone passed out as soon as they started. So then they started playing for real this time. Save for a few technical issues that Doug seemed pretty frustrated by, it was perfect. They played all the songs that I could've ever asked to hear live. For some reason I seemingly forgot how much I loved this band until they started playing. I've been into them for a couple years but last year I really went heavy on Destiny XL. Hearing them play Violence I, two feet from my face really exemplified how meaningful this music has been for me. To top it off, the last song they played (no encore btw) was one that I specificly told my friend I really wanted to hear. The Chase. It's my favourite song off their new album Lotto and it was so sick to hear live. Genuinely the worst part of this show was that it had to end. I seriously could have stood there and listened to their entire discograpy. Instead of that, we walked out of the venue and began our 3 hour trek home. Overall, extremely good concert that more than made up for the commute.</p>      </article>

      <h3>They Are Gutting A Body of Water</h3>
      <h2>  </h2>
        <i>Dec 08, 2025</i>
        <p>This should come as no surprise if you've read my interests post from a couple days ago. I've been listening to TAGABOW since 2023 when their song Eightball came up in my Spotify discover weekly. I didn't listen to much more of them for a few months when I found out (too late) that they were coming to Toronto. They were opening for Panchiko I believe and tickets for that sold out. I got really into them over the following summer and fall so when I found out they were back in Toronto in November I made sure I bought tickets as soon as I could. They were opening for Julie, who I had never heard of at the time. Also playing was Her New Knife. I was super excited to see them and had to explain to my 50+ year old co-workers that I was seeing a band called "They are gutting a body of water". Anyway by the time I got to the venue, TAGABOW had posted on their instagram account that their bus broke down and they wouldn't be able to make it to the show. That was really dissappointing but the show ended up being really good. I sorta had a Julie phase afer that. Anyway back to TAGABOW. Since finally getting to see them live the other day, I have been listening to their new album obsessively. I've been watching and reading interviews with the band in between studying for my exams. Today I taught myself the riff from "American Food" on guitar by ear. It's not perfect I think. Anyway I'm really into this album. My favourite songs are The Chase, Sour Diesel, Trainers, and American Food. I need to figure out how to make music that sounds like this. This will be my winter break project once exams are done.</p>

      <h2>  </h2>
      <i>Nov 27, 2025</i>
        <p>Music, I feel has been my most "legitimate" creative output for the better part of 6 years. I started doing this with no prior training, no knowledge of software, no ability to play any instruments. Tutorials bored me. All of the progress I made in this medium was through trial and error. Progress was very slow, and my limited ability led me to establish my own workflow and methods. I created the vast majority of my music between 2020-2023. I have never stopped but I have significantly slowed down. I still write songs often, just fewer are recorded and developed. This is not an amazing feeling but my life has changed greatly in very positive ways that unfortunately did not translate to music. Still I feel the quality of what I do record has continued to increase. I am immesnely proud of the 200 some songs that I have recorded. I encourage anyone reading this to listen to the songs below and explore what else exists on my bandcamp profile. In the past all of my music was recorded using FL Studio. I was initially very unhappy with the sound of VST instruments. This led me to become effective enough at playing a number of instruments. To date I can play the Guitar, Bass, Drums, Accordion, and Banjo. I would like to add musical saw to this list. Recently I have begun using Ableton. Despite a lack of output to prove the following statement, I do believe that my songwriting is in the best place it's ever been. Time will tell if this is true.</p>
