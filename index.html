      <p>If you are already on this website I think it's safe to assume you at least vaguely know of me. That's really the best case scenario.</p>
      <p>This website is a place for me to practice sincerity. That's my understanding of it right now at least. I'm not making any effort for the writings here to be perceived in any way, they are very much just straight from my head.</p>
      <p>This is effectively a journal of sorts. Only made public. Mostly I just write about things that interest me. Opinions. I wouldn't consider this a website of any serious societal value. The only thing you can learn about on here is me. But I think that's okay. I know the value that I get out of it at least, and I'm the one paying for the domain name at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>Genuinely everything on this website is an invitation for a discussion. I like writing about things but I love talking about things with people way more. If I write something on here and you disagree I want to hear about it. Or if you have something you think I should see or a song you think I should hear, tell me.</p>
      <p>Maybe that's the point of this website.</p>
      <p>Anyway, below is Nick Mullen. My hero.</p>

        <h3>The Roundtable</h3>
        <h2> </h2>
        <i>Feb 07, 2026</i>
        <p>What are the worst traits a person can have, like personality wise? On one extreme lays the psychopath with no empathy, no regard for others. Some people are narcissists, and self absorbed. There are those who are lazy, lack willpower, the list goes on and on. Afterall, no one is perfect. The irony however, is that for some of these examples, people with these frowned upon traits are rewarded for having them. No doubt the business work is dominated by individuals better described as monsters than people. There's nothing virtuous or admirable about being one of the richest people on the planet but we still use words like success to describe them. We now also live in an age where we reward the most self absorbed, more than ever before. Social media has created an ecosystem where the most histrionic type of person can demand more attention in one day than most would recieve in a lifetime. I'm not really trying to explain why this is bad or anything related to the topic of a declining culture. Rather in an era of viral moments and celebrity, cult of personality, parasocial relationships, and the emergence of the influencer class I'm left wondering how much of this, if any, is new?</p>
        <p>Several months ago an old clip from The Simpsons appeared on my YouTube homepage. For some reason I clicked on it and for reasons I still do not fully understand, I fell in love with the 39 second excerpt. I recommend watching it but to summarize this brief clip even briefer, it's Homer Simpson being a cosmopolitian fancy dinner host. Something about that 15 second segment of this clip makes me genuinely yearn for this kind of socializing. I want to dress up and enertain guests with whimsical quips. "So I said, I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini" Homer says. The video has stuck with me for many months it seems, evidenced by tonight. After making dinner and helping myself to a generous pour of wine, I recalled the video and watched it no less than 5 times in a row. I went to the comments section hoping to learn of similar clips, inspirations for the clip, or source material. Little did I know a comment referencing the "Algonquin Roundtable" would lead me to spend hours searching for and watching decades old documentaries.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, the martini line did not come from The Simpsons writing staff. Everything in this scene was parody, though not of an old movie or tv show, but rather a small group of real life writors and friends in New York City in the 1920s. Starting in 1919 and lasting until about 1930, the Algonquin Roundtable as it was latter dubbed, was a gathering of yet successful newpaper and magazine columnists. The name came from the hotel they would meet at to eat lunch everyday. I do mean every single day. For over a decade, at a large roundtable in the hotel, numerous screenwritors, critics, columnists, and poets would meet for one most admirable purpose. To roast each other. Seriously. Almost every single sentence included a targeted attack, dressed up with fancy wordplay. The group was not viewed favourably, many considered them to have inflated egos, to be overly harsh and critical of others. Regardless, this table was the birthplace of observational comedy, self deprecation, and many other comedic tropes that continue to be utilized everyday. It's impossible to say for sure that they were invented here but this group no doubt developed and popularized them. Over the span of the decade about a half dozen pullitzer prizes would come out of this group. Some of the first oscar nominated films, numerous broadway plays, novels, and famously, the New Yorker magazine were born from the roundtable. However what's interesting is that even before any of the members would go onto achieve these things, a never before seen following would emerge surrounding them. This group contributed much of what was going to print everyday in New York City. Details of their lives, their conversations, and their roundtable antics would make it into these columns. This functioned almost as a precursor to social media. Pre-internet content.</p>
        <p>I would consider the members of the Algonquin Roundtable the social media influencers of their day and the group as a whole something like an antique influencer collective/network. Some similarities that immediately come to mind are the combination of exclusivity with accessbility. That is to say, the published daily interactions made the public feel involved despite obvious distance and lack of acquaintance. Think of the streamer or daily vlogger who benefits from appearing accessible and friendly to fans but would obviously never consider one of these fans to be in their circle. During their rise, the Algonquin Roundtable was not obviously talented. They found little success from writing. It was instead their daily interactions that were sought after. I'm sure all of us can think of a million podcasters or tiktokers who really don't have any skills, talents, or reason to be on the world stage. Yet they are, just for their personalities. Finally, we saw with the Algonquin Roundtable that in many cases their involvement in the group served as a launchpad that helped them to achieve all kinds of serious artistic accomplishments or at the very least major financial success. For almost two decades now, we have been seeing the rise of the influencer in music, in hollywood, and in business. It's for these reasons that I see the Algonquin Roundtable members as the influencers of their time. Perhaps this brief period in the 1920s foreshadowed the reward system that society would go onto create for the self-absorbed. </p>

      <h3>They Are Gutting A Body of Water</h3>
      <h2>  </h2>
        <i>Dec 08, 2025</i>
        <p>This should come as no surprise if you've read my interests post from a couple days ago. I've been listening to TAGABOW since 2023 when their song Eightball came up in my Spotify discover weekly. I didn't listen to much more of them for a few months when I found out (too late) that they were coming to Toronto. They were opening for Panchiko I believe and tickets for that sold out. I got really into them over the following summer and fall so when I found out they were back in Toronto in November I made sure I bought tickets as soon as I could. They were opening for Julie, who I had never heard of at the time. Also playing was Her New Knife. I was super excited to see them and had to explain to my 50+ year old co-workers that I was seeing a band called "They are gutting a body of water". Anyway by the time I got to the venue, TAGABOW had posted on their instagram account that their bus broke down and they wouldn't be able to make it to the show. That was really dissappointing but the show ended up being really good. I sorta had a Julie phase afer that. Anyway back to TAGABOW. Since finally getting to see them live the other day, I have been listening to their new album obsessively. I've been watching and reading interviews with the band in between studying for my exams. Today I taught myself the riff from "American Food" on guitar by ear. It's not perfect I think. Anyway I'm really into this album. My favourite songs are The Chase, Sour Diesel, Trainers, and American Food. I need to figure out how to make music that sounds like this. This will be my winter break project once exams are done.</p>

      <h3>More Music!</h3>
      <h2> </h2>
      <i>Jan 15, 2026</i>
      <p>I started recording full length original songs using a guitar in October of 2020. I was in grade 12 and was just about to turn 17. This started a 2-3 year period where I was constantly making new songs. You could call this my most prolific creative era. I was making about 40 songs per year? I never considered any of them to be finished or "real" songs that people would listen to. In the back of my head I always just viewed them as practice and each song was a step towards one day making something to a finished, "real" level of quality. I'm not sure if I ever really reached that point but over the years as I got better I had loftier expectations for the quality of my songs and recordings. Little did I know, pursuing this would turn recording into an unreasonably major task. Suddenly writing and recording a song turned from something I could do in a single day, into something that took weeks or months of trial and error. The finished product got a lot better but it became more a lot more trouble that it was really worth especially considering an increasing workload in school, jobs, relationships, etc. I don't think I will ever say I'm done with music, because I think saying that would cause some kind of serious crisis or ego death as this really was my whole life for a very long time. But yeah, the dream of doing this in a professional context is certainly not on my mind to the extent that it was a few years ago. That's not to say that was ever really my goal. My goal right from the start was just to have something that, in the future I can look back on. From this perspective I have absolutely achieved what I wanted to and then some. Over the years I have always had these songs available to me privately and I would revisit them every so often. I get a lot of value even from the oldest ones. I'll hear something in a horrible, noisy recording that makes me stop in awe that I did this. I think it's really unlikely that I will ever reach the same level of output that I was able to achieve at 17, but I would like to at least have a few "unfinished" recordings every year. I've never been someone that takes photos. Not to diminish the value of photos but I don't think looking at a photo holds a candle to listening to a song you made years and years ago. I can very vividly remember where I was and what was going on in my life when I listen to most of them. These songs are the closest thing I have to a scrapbook and I hope to add to it throughout my life.</p>
