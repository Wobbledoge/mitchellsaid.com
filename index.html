      <h2> </h2>
      <i>Nov 27, 2025</i>
        <p>My name is Mitchell Said. I was born on October 10th, 2003. This means I am 22 years old. I have chosen to make a blog because I have become dissillusioned with the current implementation of social media. I hope that this blog can be a healthier expression of myself.</p>
        <p>I want this website to be a place where I can talk about whatever I want. Separate from the whole social media thing, I have wanted to start a blog for a while. I have a lot of views and opinions that I want to share. I want to practice writing on here, a skill that has been lost after a half decade of engineering study. I am also a pretty political guy, in a far left kind of way. So it is also possible that there will be articles or opinion pieces on here relating to that. I also have a place to write about my interests past and present. A place to document my listening tastes and preferences. And finally a place to share some of my own creative output.</p>
        <P>Anyway some more about me. My role models/inspirations are Nick Mullen, Joshua Citarella, Che Guevara, and honestly Zohran Mamdani. Seriously that guy is one of the most inspring things to happen in my lifetime and I believe that wholeheartedly.</P>
        <p>Below is my friend Nick Mullen.</p>

        <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <h2> </h2>
        <i>Jan 14, 2026</i>
        <p>Stereotypes are generally pretty bad. Like universally I would say it's not very good to promote stereotypes because they are usually racist or sexist or otherwise pretty evil. That being said, today I have been thinking about a new stereotype that I am surprised doesn't already exist. My stereotype is that of the late riser. The opposite of the early bird. I genuinely think that there needs to be a lot more societal pressure to encourage healthy sleep habits. I say this as someone who has for my entire life struggled with sleep. For literally as long as I can remember I have never been a morning person. This is a cutesy label I suppose that normalizes and excuses a bad habit. Then as soon as I had the agency to set my own bedtime things got really bad and for the most part have never gotten better. I don't think I have maintained a consistent, eight hours of sleep per night sleep schedule since maybe grade 9? Even while working a full time job. At one of my jobs I was actually able to graph my clock in times (see below). Ideally it would be a flat line but no, not for me. For me I have a consistent almost perfectly linear line. Despite this utter failure to show up to work reliably, nobody ever made any serious comment on it. So that being said I think this qualifies me to speak on the topic of bad sleep schedules.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of behaviours that society has deemed unacceptable. If you have bad hygiene for example, people might not say anything to your face but you will be ridiculed for it. Despite a lot of recent efforts the same is true for problems with addiction, homelessness, teen pregnancy, etc. There is stigma, shame, and just general negativity associated with these things, and I will not go into whether or not it is valid. I think the reason society rejects these things is that they place a lot of strain on other people. Families, relationships, employers, are all affected by the "failures" of an individual. This is where poor sleep habits differ. Typically poor sleep habits exclusively impact the individual. It kind of puts into perspective that the reason people are so opposed to the other behaviours mentioned is not out of care for another person, but instead out of selfishness. Maybe this is obvious. A weird quirk of poor sleep habits is that, despite their destructive impacts, they get glorified in a lot of situations. Think of the start up founder, the office worker that goes above and beyond. On the other side of the spectrum, the partier, or rave goer. In these contexts being up late, getting few hours of sleep is a badge of honour. In my own experience I have never tried to hide my poor sleep schedule. Being a university student, I think this is probably the most accepted environment for this kind of thing. Most people are either in the same position or are willing to laugh without much serious thought when I joke about my situation.</p>
        <p>I want to feel shame. Society has made a very strong effort to ensure that no one feels ashamed over poor habits or traits and yeah in most of those situations I agree. But not this. It feels backwards and almost like an obsolete way of thinking but I really do think people like me deserve to be ostricized for this. If I was met with pure, vitriolic digust, maybe I would change. Is external motivation what's missing? Lets be clear I have a lot of personal motivation to clean up my act. It's not a very pleasent feeling to wake up and the sun has already set. I cannot count the amount of classes I have slept through. When I have any kind of appointment or exam or lab I need to pray that I can flip my sleep schedule around on a whim. It's not just about waking up late either, you can wake up early and still have horrible sleep habits. Going to work on 4 hours of sleep is a miserable feeling. All of this is horrible and should be reason enough to fix things but clearly for me it isn't. I want to face social consequences. I want 1920s political satire cartoon caricitures of the late riser. It needs to be disgusting, a complete slob. I don't want fairness or accuracy, I want motivation.</p>
        <p>There definitely are extenuating circumstances with this topic and I understand this. Those are not what I'm referring to. If you work a night shift this is completely acceptable. If you have actual medical conditions affecting your sleep of course I am not advocating for your ridicule. This is meant to target the individual who stays up late with no purpose beyond scrolling, or watching youtube, or playing videogames, or whatever other thing it may be. This kind of person should be tarred and feathered in the street.</p>

      <h3>They Are Gutting A Body of Water</h3>
      <h2>  </h2>
        <i>Dec 08, 2025</i>
        <p>This should come as no surprise if you've read my interests post from a couple days ago. I've been listening to TAGABOW since 2023 when their song Eightball came up in my Spotify discover weekly. I didn't listen to much more of them for a few months when I found out (too late) that they were coming to Toronto. They were opening for Panchiko I believe and tickets for that sold out. I got really into them over the following summer and fall so when I found out they were back in Toronto in November I made sure I bought tickets as soon as I could. They were opening for Julie, who I had never heard of at the time. Also playing was Her New Knife. I was super excited to see them and had to explain to my 50+ year old co-workers that I was seeing a band called "They are gutting a body of water". Anyway by the time I got to the venue, TAGABOW had posted on their instagram account that their bus broke down and they wouldn't be able to make it to the show. That was really dissappointing but the show ended up being really good. I sorta had a Julie phase afer that. Anyway back to TAGABOW. Since finally getting to see them live the other day, I have been listening to their new album obsessively. I've been watching and reading interviews with the band in between studying for my exams. Today I taught myself the riff from "American Food" on guitar by ear. It's not perfect I think. Anyway I'm really into this album. My favourite songs are The Chase, Sour Diesel, Trainers, and American Food. I need to figure out how to make music that sounds like this. This will be my winter break project once exams are done.</p>

        <p>Music, I feel has been my most "legitimate" creative output for the better part of 6 years. I started doing this with no prior training, no knowledge of software, no ability to play any instruments. Tutorials bored me. All of the progress I made in this medium was through trial and error. Progress was very slow, and my limited ability led me to establish my own workflow and methods. I created the vast majority of my music between 2020-2023. I have never stopped but I have significantly slowed down. I still write songs often, just fewer are recorded and developed. This is not an amazing feeling but my life has changed greatly in very positive ways that unfortunately did not translate to music. Still I feel the quality of what I do record has continued to increase. I am immesnely proud of the 200 some songs that I have recorded. I encourage anyone reading this to listen to the songs below and explore what else exists on my bandcamp profile. In the past all of my music was recorded using FL Studio. I was initially very unhappy with the sound of VST instruments. This led me to become effective enough at playing a number of instruments. To date I can play the Guitar, Bass, Drums, Accordion, and Banjo. I would like to add musical saw to this list. Recently I have begun using Ableton. Despite a lack of output to prove the following statement, I do believe that my songwriting is in the best place it's ever been. Time will tell if this is true.</p>
